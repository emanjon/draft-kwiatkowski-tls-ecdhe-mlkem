              Hybrid ECDHE-Kyber Key Exchange for TLSv1.3
                draft-kwiatkowski-tls-ecdhe-kyber-latest

Abstract

   This draft requests codepoints for hybrid key exchange in TLS 1.3
   [hybrid] that combines the post-quantum Kyber KEM [kyber] with a
   elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) key exchange based on eliptic
   curves secp256r1 (NIST P-256) and secp384r1 (NIST P-384).

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation

   The final draft for Kyber is expected in 2024.  There are already
   early deployments of post-quantum key agreement, with more to come
   before Kyber is standardised.  To promote interoperability of early
   implementations, this document specifies a preliminary hybrid post-
   quantum key agreement.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Security Considerations

   TODO

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests/registers a new entry to the TLS Named Group
   (or Supported Group) registry, according to the procedures in
   Section 6 of [tlsiana].
