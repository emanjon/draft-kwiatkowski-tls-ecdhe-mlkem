              Hybrid ECDHE-Kyber Key Agreement for TLSv1.3
                draft-kwiatkowski-tls-ecdhe-kyber-latest

Abstract

   This draft defines a hybrid key agreement for TLS 1.3 that combines a
   post-quantum KEM with elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE).

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation

   Kyber is a key encapsulation method (KEM) designed to be resistant to
   cryptanalytic attacks with quantum computers.  Standardization of
   Kyber KEM is expected to be finalized in 2024.

   Experimentation and early deployments are crucial part of the
   migration to post-quantum cryptography.  To promote interoperability
   of those deployments this document provides specification of
   preliminary hybrid post-quantum key agreement to be used in TLS 1.3
   protocol.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Negotiated Groups

   This document defines additional supported groups which can be used
   for hybrid post-quantum key agreements.  The hybrid key agreement for
   TLS 1.3 is detailed in the [hybrid] draft.  We compose the hybrid
   scheme with the Kyber KEM as defined in [kyber] draft, and the ECDHE
   scheme parametrized with elliptic curves defined in ANSI X9.62
   [ECDSA] and FIPS 186-5 [DSS].

3.1.  Construction

   The client's share is a concatenation of the ECDHE ephemeral share
   and Kyber's public key.  The server's share is a concatenation of
   ECDHE ephemeral share and Kyber's ciphertext returned from
   encapsulation (see [kyber]).  Finally, the shared secret is a
   concatenation of the ECDHE shared secret and the Kyber's shared
   secret value returned from either encapsulation (on the server side)
   or decapsulation (on the client side).

3.2.  Defined Hybrid Groups

   The table below lists all additional supported groups defined by this
   document and provides the total size (in bytes) of generated shares
   and calculated secret.

   +---------------------+--------------+--------------+---------------|
   | Hybrid Group name   | Client Share | Server Share | Shared Secret |
   +---------------------+--------------+--------------+---------------|
   | secp256r1_kyber768  |         1248 |         1152 |            64 |
   | secp384r1_kyber768  |         1280 |         1184 |            80 |
   | secp384r1_kyber1024 |         1664 |         1664 |            80 |
   +---------------------+--------------+--------------+---------------|

4.  Security Considerations

   The same security considerations as those described in [hybrid] apply
   to the approach used by this document.  Implementers are encouraged
   to use implementations resistant to side-channel attacks, especially
   those that can be applied by remote attackers.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests/registers a new entry to the TLS Named Group
   (or Supported Group) registry, according to the procedures in
   Section 6 of [tlsiana].
