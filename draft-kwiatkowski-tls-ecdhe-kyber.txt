1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation

   Kyber is a key encapsulation method (KEM) designed to be resistant to
   cryptanalytic attacks with quantum computers.  Standardization of
   Kyber KEM is expected to be finalized in 2024.

   Experimentation and early deployments are crucial part of the
   migration to post-quantum cryptography.  To promote interoperability
   of those deployments this document provides specification of
   preliminary hybrid post-quantum key agreement to be used in TLS 1.3
   protocol.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Negotiated Groups

   This document defines an additional supported group which can be used
   for hybrid post-quantum key agreements.  The hybrid key agreement for
   TLS 1.3 is detailed in the [hybrid] draft.  We compose the hybrid
   scheme with the Kyber KEM as defined in [kyber] draft, and the ECDHE
   scheme parametrized with elliptic curves defined in ANSI X9.62
   [ECDSA] and NIST SP 800-186 [DSS].

   The new group allows deriving TLS session keys by using FIPS-approved
   schemes.  NIST's special publication 800-56Cr2 [SP56C] approves the
   usage of HKDF [HKDF] with two distinct shared secrets as long as the
   first one is computed by a FIPS-approved key-establishment scheme.
   Both ECDHE and a curve secp256r1 (NIST P-256) are FIPS-approved by
   NIST SP 800-56Ar3 [SP56A] and NIST SP 800-186 [DSS] correspondingly.

3.1.  Construction

   The name of the new supported hybrid post-quantum group is
   secp256r1_kyber768round3_d00.

   When this group is negotiated, the client's share is a fixed-size
   concatenation of the ECDHE share and Kyber's public key.  The client
   ECDHE share is the serialized value of the uncompressed ECDH point
   representation as defined in Section 4.2.8.2 of [RFC8446].  Its size
   for secp256r1 is 64 bytes.  The Kyber ephemeral share is the public
   key output of the KeyGen step (see [kyber]) represented as an octet
   string.  Its size for kyber768 is 1184 bytes.  The whole client's
   share is 64+1184=1248 bytes.

   The server's share is a fixed-size concatenation of ECDHE share and
   Kyber's ciphertext returned from encapsulation (see [kyber]).  The
   server ECDHE share is the serialized value of the uncompressed ECDH
   point representation UncompressedPointRepresentation as defined in
   Section 4.2.8.2 of [RFC8446].  Its size for secp256r1 is 64 bytes.
   The server share is the Kyber's ciphertext returned from the
   Encapsulate step (see [kyber]) represented as an octet string.  Its
   size for kyber768 is 1088 bytes.  The whole server's share is
   64+1088=1152 bytes.

   Finally, the shared secret is a concatenation of the ECDHE and the
   Kyber shared secrets.  The ECDHE shared secret is x-coordinate of the
   ECDH shared secret elliptic curve point represented as an octet
   string as defined in Section 7.4.2 of [RFC8446].  Its size for
   secp256r1 is 32 bytes.  The Kyber shared secret is the value returned
   from either encapsulation (on the server side) or decapsulation (on
   the client side) represented as an octet string.  Its size for
   kyber768 is 32 bytes.  The whole shared secret is 32+32=64 bytes.

4.  Security Considerations

   The same security considerations as those described in [hybrid] apply
   to the approach used by this document.  Implementers are encouraged
   to use implementations resistant to side-channel attacks, especially
   those that can be applied by remote attackers.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests/registers a new entry to the TLS Named Group
   (or Supported Group) registry, according to the procedures in
   Section 6 of [tlsiana].  These identifiers are to be used with the
   point-in-time specified versions of Kyber in the third round of
   NIST's Post-quantum Project which is specified in [kyber].  The
   identifiers used with the final, ratified by NIST, version of Kyber
   will be specified later with in a different draft.  [ EDNOTE: The
   identifiers for the final, ratified version of Kyber should
   preferrably by different that the commonly used OQS codepoints
   (https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/blob/OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-
   stable/oqs-template/oqs-kem-info.md) ]
